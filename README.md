# baddsert

Framework for baseline acceptance driven development in JavaScript.

General idea: It's annoying to maintain tests.  Every time you change an api, all the tests fail and they need to be manually updated.

BADD keeps tracks of the new info on failures and allows you to automagically update the expected data.
